The purpose of this project is to propose a model that can classify if a patient will show up to his appointment at the doctor given demographics info on the patient, his or her medical profile and carachteristics on the appointment.

Our approach is divided into 3 parts:
1) data cleaning
2) Feature engineering and statistical analysis
3) Model selection (tried multiple models with different input and parameter tuning)
